# Streetview Ripper

Streetview Ripper will automatically download Streetview spheres from a user-provided list of URLs. A range of quality levels are available, from 512x512 to 13312x6656.

This tool is intended for offline image research purposes - the downloaded images should not be distributed. All rights to all Streetview imagery remains with Google.
